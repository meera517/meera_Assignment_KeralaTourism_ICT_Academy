    <img src="../images/padmanabha3.jpg">  
    <p></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10px;">Located inside the East Fort in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of the State of Kerala in India is the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. This temple is a blend of the Kerala and Dravidian styles of architecture. It is believed to be the world’s richest temple.

      The history of Padmanabhaswamy Temple dates back to 8th century. It is one of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or Divya Desams in India. Divya Desams are the holiest abodes of Lord Vishnu that are mentioned in the works of the Tamil Azhvars (saints). The presiding deity of this temple is Lord Vishnu, reclining on Anantha, the hooded Serpent.
      
      Marthanda Varma,  noted among Travancore kings, did a major renovation to the temple and it resulted in the present day structure of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. It was Marthanda Varma who introduced the Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam festivals in the temple. Murajapam, which literally means continuous chanting of prayers, is still conducted in the temple once every six years.
      <br><br>
      In 1750, Marthanda Varma dedicated the kingdom of Travancore to Lord Padmanabha. Marthanda Varma vowed that the royal family will rule the State on behalf of the Lord and he and his descendants would serve the kingdom as Padmanabha Dasa or the Servant of Lord Padmanabha. Since then the name of every Travancore King was preceded by the title Padmanabha Dasa. The donation of the kingdom of Travancore to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thripadidanam.
      
      Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala takes its name from the presiding deity of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, who is also known as Anantha (one who reclines on the Serpent Anantha). The word 'Thiruvananthapuram' literally means - the Land of Sree Anantha Padmanabhaswamy. 
      
      The Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as per belief is located at a place that is considered as one of the seven Parasurama Kshetras. There are references to the temple in texts like the Puranas, viz. the Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. The temple stands close to the holy tank - Padma Theertham, which means 'lotus spring.'
      
      The shrine is currently run by a trust headed by the erstwhile royal family of Travancore.</p>

    <br><br>
    Ponmudi is a breathtaking hill station situated at the southern stretch of Western Ghats. Located within a short driving distance from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, Ponmudi literally means The Golden Peak.

The first thing that travellers to Ponmudi notice is the thick tropical forests that carpets the foot of the hill range. Hairpin bends, steep climb and mist covered stretches marks the route to Ponmudi from Kallar, located at the base of the village.

Located close to Agasthyar Hills, one of the biggest peaks in Western Ghats, Ponmudi offers excellent trekking and camping opportunities. Trekking through the thick forests one gets to see assortment of mountain flowers, unusual butterflies and small rivulets. However, the incline is steep and the trek rigorous.
