    <p style="text-indent: 10px;">
      Illikkal Kallu is a monolith located on top of the Illickal Malaa in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India.The distance from kottayam railway station to illikal kallu is 57km. Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek 1 km to reach the summit of the peak.
      <br><br>
      Illikkal Mala comprises three hills, each rising up to 3,400 ft above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). There is a 1‚ÅÑ2-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell) connecting these two hills. The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to that of the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal. It is said that the mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here. This mythical blue flower is also believed to possess supernatural powers, which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest.

From the hilltops, the Arabian Sea can be seen on the far horizon as a thin blue stroke. The view of the sunset from above the peak in the evening of a full moon day can be sensational: the moon can be seen rising up like another sun, as the orange sun goes down.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 10px; ">
      Ilaveezhapoonchira is a tourist destination located in Melukavu village in Kottayam district near Kanjar. Ilaveezha Poonchira is surrounded by three enchanting hillocks - Mankunnu, Kodayathoormala and Thonippara. This makes the place ideal for trekking.
<br><br>
According to a legend, the Pandava had a sojourn here during their life incognito. Their wife, Draupadi, came to take a bath at a lake, which was present at that time. Some devas, bewitched by her beauty, tried to satisfy their voyeuristic itch. King of devas, Lord Indra, came to know about what was going on, and built screens or hills heaping flowers and prevented them from indulging in such a practice. And the pond thus became a dam isolated by floral hills. Since there were no trees around the bund, it was always free of leaves and so it was called Ila-veezha-poonchira. Some say that the name comes from the fact that it is always windy at the place and hence the leaves are carried away.
Poonjira's myth is closely related to Agastya and his hermitage, he lived here and the native people believes that he still lives here, his hermitage is hidden in somewhere here. Another important attraction is the ancient Krishna temple, that was founded by Panjali herself.the mass belief is that panjali's akshayapatra is hidden here and it is protected by agastya. The myth is also associate with Ramayana his vanavasa popularly believes that he lived here with Lakshmana for few months
